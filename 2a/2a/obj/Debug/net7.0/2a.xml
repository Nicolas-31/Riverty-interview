            from currency, to currency, the amount to convert, and an optional date for historical rates.</param>
            <returns>

            <remarks>
            This endpoint receives a POST request with the conversion details. 
            It performs an asynchronous operation to convert the specified amount from the source to the target currency.
            If the conversion is successful, a <see cref="!:ConversionResponse"/> is returned with the result.
            In case of an error, such as an invalid currency code or an exception in the conversion process,
            a BadRequest is returned along with the error details.
